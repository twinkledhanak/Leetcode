1. Remember to check if ptr is null
if(ptr != null) rather than if(ptr.next != null)

Only when we return last node, keep track as follows:
while (cur != null && cur.next != null) {
        cur = cur.next;
    }

2. Never lose track of Head 

3. Never make any operation such that we lose entire chain of LL after a node

4. We can easily achieve Time: O(n) and Space: O(1) in LLs, just using ptr
