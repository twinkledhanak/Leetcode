// Given a node, first create an in-order traversal from it
// Convert this in-order to pre-order by recursively splitting in the middle  
// When splitting in middle, we can create a height balanced tree

// Time complexity: Time to create in-order + pre-order
// O(n)

// Space complexity: It is a height balanced tree
// O(logN)
