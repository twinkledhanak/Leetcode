// Since each node in the tree is visited only once, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
//  We cannot do better than that, since at the very least we have to visit each node to invert it.

// Because of recursion, O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case, where h is the height of the tree.
//  Because hâˆˆO(n), the space complexity is O(n).
